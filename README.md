## Project Overview
This project is based on the game HangMan.

In this game, the user must guess the full word before hangman is hung. This is done by guessing a letter in the word.

If the guess is right, it is placed in the blank spaces that make up the word.
If it is not, the user loses a life. The word must be guessed before the user runs out of lives.

Furthermore, I have added different difficulties to the game, along with a leaderboard displaying the top 10 players.

## Goal

My goal is to utilise my knowledge of python to create a game which gathers user inputs and provides responses based on the input given.
I utilised this to create the main function of the game, as well as to collect data to add to the leaderboard.

## Technologies used
<b>Python</b> for the main game-play.
Heroku to deploy the website.
GitHub as a remote repository.
GitPod as a local repository and for editing code
https://lucid.app/ for creating charts
[Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/) (API) for the leadboard
